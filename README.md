# final-university-project

This was the final project submission of my undergraduate degree. The project was split over two courses ECSE-456/457 and for the most part the project was the only thing I was graded on.

I worked with another student on this project and we ended up winning second place in the final presentation for the project. There were many elements to the project and we worked on many different software systems and even made use of a Fanuc Robotic arm.

After graduating I continued working on this project for 4 months until I started my first full time position at another company.
